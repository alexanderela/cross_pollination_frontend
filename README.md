# World of Flags
World of flags is a mobile app designed to help users teach themselves the flags of the world.  Its underlying goal is to stimulate users’ curiosity about the world by familiarizing them  with different countries’ flags.
## Deployed App (Front End): [World of Flags Front End](https://world-of-flags.herokuapp.com/)
#### Deployed App (Back End): [World of Flags Back End](https://world-of-flags-backend.herokuapp.com/)
#### Back End Repo: [World of Flags Back End](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/world-of-flags-backend)


When interacting with World of Flags, users are shown  a randomly generated  flag from one of the world’s 193 countries and then can choose between 4 country options.

If they get stuck, users can request up to 2 hints about the country whose flag they are guessing.  These hints consist of facts about the country or an image of the country’s outline.  By viewing these hints, users can grow to associate different flags with facts about their countries.

As users correctly guess different flags, they will accumulate points.  In this way, World of Flags aims to make learning about the world a fun and enjoyable process.
